Hi there 👋

My name is Becem and I'm from Tunisia. I'm an electromechanical engineer and a self-taught software developer.

My GitHub journey is about making the Nuxt 3 experience even more simple. I specialize in developing Nuxt 3 modules and starters that provide ready to use solutions. 

Beyond the world of web development, I'm deeply passionate about IoT. I specialize in developing ESP32 based solutions and working on projects such as [ESP Admin](https://github.com/esp-admin) that accelerate the development process.

In case You have any question related to my work, feel free to reach me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becem-gharbi-142523195) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/Becem#6401).
