Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Becem and I'm from Tunisia. I'm an electromechanical engineer and a self-taught software developer. 

My goal here on GitHub is to help accelerate the development process

- In web, I specialize in developing Nuxt 3 modules for handling common tasks such as authentication.

- In IoT, I specialize in developing ESP32 based solutions such as [ESP Admin](https://github.com/esp-admin) for handling needed tasks such as OTA.

In case you have any questions, feel free to reach me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/becem-gharbi-142523195) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/Becem#6401).
